The solar panel system incorporates Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to monitor light intensity, adjusting panel orientation through servo motors. Three panels are linked to servos for elevation control, activated by a push button. The LDRs detect variances in light intensity, prompting corresponding panel adjustments. Efficiency is ensured by comparing solar panel and battery voltages, allowing charging when the battery voltage is lower. If the battery voltage exceeds the solar input, the battery can power the solar manager, facilitating output via a USB port. This system exemplifies a self-sustaining approach to battery charging using solar energy, showcasing a practical application of renewable energy technology in achieving efficient and autonomous power management.
